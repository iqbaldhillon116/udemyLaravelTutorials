NOTE: To use Elquent Commands in laravel you first have to create model and then we can access all the eolquent properties to access database.
We have defined the steps of how to create model in artisan commands.

Q.How to read data from database with eloquent ?
 
 firstly we have to add the namespace of model which we have creted and then we can access the properties.

 use App\post;

=> $result = Post::all();
   to fetch all data.

=> $result = Post::find(1);

   here we are passing primary key id = 1 to get row  from table posts.

Q. How to get data with constraints?

=> $result = Post::where('id',1)->orderBy('id','desc')->take(1)->get();

    this will return us an array of object.

=> $result = Post::findorFail(1);
   this function will either give you result if found or it will give you exception to handle instead of giving error.

=> $result = Post::where('users_count' , '<' , 50)->firstorFail();
   here we can note that where function can take three arguments to add much better constraints.

Q. How to insert data with eloquent ?

 firstly create an object of model in your funcition to access the table columns with it.

=> $post = new Post;

 now access columns and assign data to it.

=> $post->title = 'new title' ;

=> $post->content = 'this is content';
 now use save method of model to insert the the above data.

=> $post->save();

Q. how to update data?

we can use the above same method but with small change,instead of creating an object to save data , we have to find the row  whcih we want to update.

ie. $post = Post::find(1);

=> $post->title = 'new updation';
=> $post->content = ' content updation';

=> $post->save();

Q. How to add data with create method ?

we cannot insert data for multiple columns at once means in single line without declaring permission in model

to insert multiple data we need to override the fillable property of model as follows,

protected $fillable =  ['title','content','is_admin'];//here we are getting permission to save data in following columns

now we can use create command

=>post::create(['title'=>'Creating data from create command' , 'content' => 'creating content' , 'is_admin' => 1]);

Q.How to update multiple columns?

=>Post::where('id',2)->update(['title' => 'whatever you want' ,'content'=>'again whatever you want']);

Q. How to delete data?

there are two ways to delete the data

first is by finding the row and then calling delete method and second is directly calling destroy method and passing the id through it.

=>post::find(1);

  post::delete();
 
OR
=>  post::destroy(1);


Q. How to do soft delete?

1)firstly add namespace called softdeletes in model by follwing syntax,
 use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\softdeletes

 and add following code inside class

 use softdeletes;
 protectd $dates =['deleted_at']; 

 2)now create migration for add column in post table . we are creating the column 'deleted_at' to store time_stamp of deletion row

php artisan make:migration add_deleted_at_column_to_posts_tables  --table=posts


3)after creating migration add methods to up and down funciton 
 in up function write code 
      $table->softdeletes();

in down funciton write code 
      $table->dropcolumn('deleted_at');

4)use php artisan migrate command to migrate table column

5)create route for hitting softdelete method

Route::get('/softdelete',function(){
   Post::find(1)->delete();
});
